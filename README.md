About

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The dataset used for this project is the Sonar Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Each sample in the dataset  represents the energy of sonar signals at different frequencies, and a label indicating whether the signal bounced off a rock (R) or a mine (M).

This prediction can be done using machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression which is implemented in google colab.

DataSet

The dataset has been collected from UCI Repository.  This data is used for training and testing purpose. The Last column in this dataset indicates that, whether it's a mine or a rock, which is useful in prediction. 

Model 

The model implemented in this project is Logistic Regression, a statistical technique commonly used for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression leverages a logistic function, specifically the sigmoid or logit function, to predict the probability of a binary outcome. This function compresses the linear relationship between the features and the outcome into a range between 0 and 1, creating an "S"-shaped curve. By transforming values to fall within this interval, the sigmoid function effectively minimizes the impact of outliers. Given its capability to handle binary classification problems, Logistic Regression is well-suited for determining whether an object detected by sonar is a mine or a rock.

Description

The sonar data, provided in a CSV file, is utilized for both training and testing purposes. Initially, the data undergoes preprocessing to make it suitable for model training. Following this, a Logistic Regression model is developed. The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets. The training subset is used to train the model, and then the trained Logistic Regression model is applied to the new/testing data to make predictions.
